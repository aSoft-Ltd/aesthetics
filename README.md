# /home

This is the umbrela module for all our modules to make
it easy to author updates. It is powered by gitsubmodules
so keep that in mind while working from this repository

## Concept
In order to update and sync our library dependencies,
instead of one going to the individual library, they should
just checkout out this repository update dependencies from here
then update all submodules via some shell script
